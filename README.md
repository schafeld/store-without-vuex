# Store without VueX

> You don't need VueX for a rudimentary shopping cart or to share just a single piece of data across several components. Observable to the rescue!

Simple implementation of a store without the overhead of adding VueX.

Inspired by:
https://vuedose.tips/tips/creating-a-store-without-vuex-in-vue-js-2-6 and 
https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Vue-observable

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
